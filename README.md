# Extract-Faces
Have you ever work faces in the laboratory? It's a painfully time loss when you need to extract whole faces with photoshop or other apps. This basic script will extract all faces separately from the input folder and write them an output folder.

Before the run script, you need to download http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2 file and paste it into your input folder.
